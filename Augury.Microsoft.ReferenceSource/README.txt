.NET Reference Source
The referencesource repository contains sources from Microsoft .NET Reference Source that represent a subset of the .NET Framework. This subset contains similar functionality to the class libraries that are being developed in .NET Core. We intend to consult the referencesource repository as we develop .NET Core. It is also for the community to leverage to enable more scenarios for .NET developers.
